# For a poor man's static archival deployment with relative links,
# change baseurl to ".", uncomment permalink, and suffix collections > devjammer > permalink with ".html".
# Note that in-article relative links won't work and videos won't properly embed when opening via "file:///.

# Example of an FTP deployment (copy generated files in _site/ to public_html/devjammer):
# baseurl: "/~schaad/devjammer"
# url: "http://web.media.mit.edu"

# Example of a GH Pages deployment (sources pushed to repo "devjammer", branch "gh-pages"):
# baseurl: "/devjammer"
# url: "https://thedarkprojects.github.io"
